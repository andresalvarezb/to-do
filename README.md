# To Do

This project is my first approach to React.js. Making this app I can learn the bases, for example, I learned how use the states, the context, how to create functional components, etc.

### How to use it
1. Go to the [app](https://andresalvarezb.github.io/to-do)
2. Click in the button
3. Write your task and then crate the to-do
> Don´t worry about your tasks, they will be saved in you localStorage so, you can close the browser and then open it ang your tasks will still be there
